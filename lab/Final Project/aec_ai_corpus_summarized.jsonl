Once sufficient quantities of data have been collected and cleaned, they can then be used for training the machine learning algorithms that enable building systems to react to detected patterns and make informed decisions. Once data is connected, we can layer on top those machine learning algorithms that allow us to predict the behaviours of a building and its occupants, not only for efficiencies in operating and maintenance, but also to inform the way we design future buildings to optimise space and flow and select more appropriate building materials."}

Earlier this month, Politico reported that a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been \u201cdistributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.\u201d Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote."}
