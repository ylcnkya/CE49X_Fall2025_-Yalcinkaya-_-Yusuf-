    "Most importantly, this approach enables the achievement of sustainability, directly contributing to the efficient and conscious use of global resources.\n",

    "This would allow the calculator to instantly convert consumed energy into carbon emissions, clearly defining the project's environmental impact.\n",
    "At the same time, we could show the calculated performance value in comparison with national and international green building standards, such as LEED or local regulations.This feature would enable engineers and investors to check legal compliance and see the extent to which their projects are meeting sustainability.\n"
